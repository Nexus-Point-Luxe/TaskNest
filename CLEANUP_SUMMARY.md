# TaskNest Widget System Cleanup Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 🧹 File Cleanup
- **Removed duplicate enhanced widget files**: Deleted the entire `enhanced/` directory which contained duplicate widget components
- **Removed test files**: Cleaned up unnecessary test files and integration tests
- **Removed documentation duplicates**: Deleted redundant documentation files
- **Updated imports**: Fixed all broken imports in App.jsx and Sidebar.jsx

### 🎨 Layout & Spacing Fixes
- **Fixed excessive padding**: Reduced padding in ProjectDetails.jsx widget grid from `pr-3 sm:pr-4 lg:pr-6 py-3` to `p-4 lg:p-6`
- **Optimized main layout**: Removed excessive padding from Layout.jsx main container (`p-2 md:p-3` → no padding)
- **Fixed header spacing**: Updated header padding from `pr-3 sm:pr-4 lg:pr-6` to `px-4 lg:px-6`
- **Removed negative margins**: Fixed problematic negative margins (`-m-2 md:-m-3`) that were causing layout issues
- **Improved widget gap**: Optimized grid gap from `gap-3` to `gap-4` for better visual spacing

### ✅ What's Working
- **Backend Integration**: Server running successfully on port 5500 with MongoDB connection
