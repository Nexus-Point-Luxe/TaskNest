# TaskNest Development Process - 1 Week Completion Plan

## Executive Summary
Complete TaskNest development in 7 days by focusing on core functionality, bug fixes, and production readiness. Current analysis shows a solid foundation with role-based access control, widget system, and real-time features already implemented.

## Current State Analysis
✅ **Strong Foundation Exists:**
- MERN stack with role-based access control (supervisor, team-lead, team-member)
- Widget-based project details architecture
- Real-time Socket.IO communication
- AWS S3 file management
- Authentication system with JWT
- Task management with assignments
- Discussion system

❌ **Issues to Address:**
- Recent cleanup removed duplicate widgets (good)
- Need testing implementation
- Production deployment preparation
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening

## Daily Workflow
1. **Morning Standup** (15 min): Review progress, plan day
2. **Development Work** (7 hours): Focus on daily deliverables
3. **Evening Review** (30 min): Test completed work, plan next day

## Success Metrics
- All core features working properly
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Page load times < 3 seconds
- Mobile responsive design
- 99% uptime in production
- All role-based permissions working
- Real-time features stable

## Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Issues:** Focus on MVP features only
- **Time Constraints:** Cut non-essential features
- **Bugs:** Prioritize critical path functionality
- **Performance:** Optimize only bottlenecks found

## Technology Stack (No Changes)
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + MongoDB
- **Real-time:** Socket.IO
- **Authentication:** JWT
- **File Storage:** AWS S3
- **Deployment:** Simple VPS or cloud platform

## Essential Features Only
1. **User Authentication** ✅ (exists, needs refinement)
2. **Project Management** ✅ (exists, needs testing)
3. **Task Management** ✅ (exists, needs enhancement)
4. **Role-based Access** ✅ (exists, needs verification)
5. **Real-time Communication** ✅ (exists, needs optimization)
6. **File Management** ✅ (exists, needs testing)

## Non-Essential Features (Skip for Week 1)
- Advanced analytics/reporting
- Email integrations beyond basic notifications
- Advanced project templates
- Detailed audit logging
- Complex workflow automation
- Third-party integrations

## Daily Check-in Questions
1. Are core features working?
2. Is the application secure?
3. Is performance acceptable?
4. Are there any blocking issues?
5. Is deployment on track?

## Emergency Contacts & Resources
- MongoDB Atlas for database hosting
- Heroku/DigitalOcean for quick deployment
- Cloudinary as S3 alternative if needed
- SendGrid for email notifications

## Success Definition
By end of week: A fully functional project management application that users can log into, create projects, manage tasks, collaborate in real-time, and upload files - all with proper role-based access control and running in production.
