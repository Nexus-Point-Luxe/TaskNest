## Notes and Decisions

- Decision to use Tailwind CSS for styling - implemented with PostCSS
- AWS S3 selected for file storage - configuration prepared
- Chart.js selected for data visualization - packages added to frontend
- MongoDB selected as database - models created
- JWT selected for authentication - fully implemented on backend
- Project structure follows industry best practices with separation of concerns
- Focus shifted to completing frontend first, backend foundations are in place

## Next Steps
1. Complete detailed planning for Phase 1
2. Set up base application with essential configurations
3. Implement user authentication system
4. Begin development of core project and task modules
